### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± I am becoming in full stack developer thanks to IBM class and the free resource on internet. I take pleasure in exploring various programming languages and staying abreast of the latest technologies in the computer field.

- ðŸ‘¯ My first big challenge: I and a small friend group developed a website using React, Java, Google Cloud, and RabbitMQ. The website uses queues to send different messages to the microservices. You are welcome to explore my GitHub repositories ;)
  
- ðŸ“« I enjoy participating and learning in new projects. Feel free to reach out to me via email at jhoanoswaldo72@gmail.com if you require my assistance.
